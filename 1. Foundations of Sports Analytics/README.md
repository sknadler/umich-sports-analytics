## Foundations of Sports Analytics: Data, Representation, and Models in Sports
### The first course in the University of Michigan's Sports Performance Analytics specialization

This course provides an introduction to using Python to analyze team performance in sports. Learners will discover a variety of techniques that can be used to represent sports data and how to extract narratives based on these analytical techniques. The main focus of the introduction will be on the use of regression analysis to analyze team and player performance data, using examples drawn from the National Football League (NFL), the National Basketball Association (NBA), the National Hockey League (NHL), the English Premier LEague (EPL, soccer) and the Indian Premier League (IPL, cricket). 

This course does not simply explain methods and techniques, it enables the learner to apply them to sports datasets of interest so that they can generate their own results, rather than relying on the data processing performed by others.  As a consequence the learning will be empowered to explore their own ideas about sports team performance, test them out using the data, and so become a producer of sports analytics rather than a consumer.

There are six modules for this course:
- **Module 1:** Introduction to Sports Performance and Data
- **Module 2:** Introduction to Data Sources
- **Module 3:** Introduction to Sports Data and Plots in Python
- **Module 4:** Introduction to Sports Data and Regression Using Python
- **Module 5:** More on Regressions
- **Module 6:** Is There a Hot Hand in Basketball?
