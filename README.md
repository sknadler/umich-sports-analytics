# Sports Performance Analytics Specialization
### A series of massive open online course (MOOCs) from the University of Michigan

Sports analytics has emerged as a field of research with increasing popularity propelled, in part, by the real-world success illustrated by the best-selling book and motion picture, Moneyball. Analysis of team and player performance data has continued to revolutionize the sports industry on the field, court, and ice as well as in living rooms among fantasy sports players and online sports gambling.

Drawing from real data sets in Major League Baseball (MLB), the National Basketball Association (NBA), the National Hockey League (NHL), the English Premier League (EPL-soccer), and the Indian Premier League (IPL-cricket), this specialization provides exercises on how to construct predictive models to anticipate team and player performance. This specialization also features lessons on replicating the success of Moneyball using real statistical models, using the Linear Probability Model (LPM) to anticipate categorical outcomes variables in sports contests, exploring how teams collect and organize an athleteâ€™s performance data with wearable technologies, and applying machine learning in a sports analytics context.

The five folders above contain my work from the Michigan sports analytics specialization:
- **[Foundations of Sports Analytics:](https://github.com/sknadler/umich-sports-analytics/tree/main/Foundations_of_Sports_Analytics)** Use Python to analyze team performance in sports. Become a producer of sports analytics rather than a consumer.
- **Moneyball and Beyond:** Program data using Python to test the claims that lie behind the Moneyball story. Use statistics to conduct your own team and player analyses.
- **Prediction Models with Sports Data:** Learn how to generate forecasts of game results in professional sports using Python.
- **Wearable Technologies and Sports Analytics:** Understand how wearable devices can be used to help characterize both training and performance.
- **Introduction to Machine Learning in Sports Analytics:** Gain an understanding of how classification and regression techniques can be used to enable sports analytics across athletic activities and events.
